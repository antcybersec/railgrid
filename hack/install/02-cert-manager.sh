# Step 2 — cert-manager + a self-signed Issuer.
#
# The kcp-operator issues every kcp certificate (serving certs, client CAs,
# the admin kubeconfig client certs) through cert-manager. The self-signed
# Issuer lives in the SAME namespace as the kcp custom resources (default)
# because RootShard/Shard reference it by name with kind Issuer.
#
# For production TLS on the *railgrid hub* (browser-facing), see the Cloudflare
# section of the install docs — kcp itself stays on the operator-managed CA
# either way, clients trust it via the extracted kubeconfigs.

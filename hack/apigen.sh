# apigen.sh wraps kcp's apigen so that a changed APIResourceSchema gets a NEW
# name instead of being rewritten under the old one.
#
# Why this wrapper exists
# -----------------------
# APIResourceSchemas are IMMUTABLE in kcp. apigen on its own does not help you
# here: pointed at an output directory that already contains a schema, it keeps
# that schema's name and rewrites the content underneath it. The generated files
# look fine and `git diff` looks innocent — but applying them to any cluster that
# already has the old content fails with
#
#   apiresourceschemas.apis.kcp.io "v260615-841bea0.providers.admin.railgrid.ai"
#     is forbidden: [spec: Invalid value: {...}: is immutable]
#
# and the hub's bootstrap (kcp's confighelpers.Bootstrap) retries that apply
# forever without surfacing the error, so the hub simply never becomes ready.
# A one-word doc-comment edit on an exported API type was enough to do it.
#
# What it does instead
# --------------------
#   1. Runs apigen into an empty temp dir, where it mints fresh names
#      (v<yymmdd>-<HEAD-sha>) from the current CRDs.
#   2. For each schema, compares the fresh output with what is already in the
#      output dir, ignoring metadata.name:
#        - identical  -> keeps the existing file, so the name does NOT churn on
#                        every commit;
#        - different  -> takes the fresh file, so the name bumps and kcp sees a
#                        create instead of a forbidden update;
#        - new        -> takes the fresh file.
#   3. Runs apigen again against the output dir, which preserves the names
#      chosen above and regenerates the APIExports to reference them.
#
# Usage: hack/apigen.sh --input-dir <crds> --output-dir <kcp>
# Requires KCP_APIGEN_GEN (exported by the Makefile).

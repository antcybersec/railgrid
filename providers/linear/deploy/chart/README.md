# Linear provider Helm chart

Installs one standalone Linear provider with embedded portal, controller,
webhook receiver, and MCP endpoint. All durable state lives in tenant KRM
resources; no additional database or PVC is required. Use the repository root
as Docker build context: `docker build -f providers/linear/Dockerfile .`.

Two hosting Secrets must be supplied, each with a `kubeconfig` key:

- `providerKubeconfig.secretName`: bootstrap identity for the one-shot init.
- `runtimeKubeconfig.secretName`: provider ServiceAccount identity for export
  virtual-workspace access and authenticated heartbeats.

Init installs the generated schemas, APIExport, endpoint slice, bind grant and
CatalogEntry. Enable the provider in a tenant and accept its `secrets/get` claim.
Keep bootstrap credentials out of the runtime Secret. Existing tenant bindings
do not silently gain future claims; re-enable or migrate when claims change.

| Value | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `image.repository` | `ghcr.io/faroshq/faros-linear-provider` | Provider image. |
| `image.tag` | chart appVersion | Explicit image version override. |
| `image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull behavior. |
| `workspacePath` | `root:faros:providers:linear` | Fully qualified provider workspace; override for org-owned hosting. |
| `replicaCount` | `1` | One replica required for bounded event admission. |
| `service.type` / `service.port` | `ClusterIP` / `8092` | HTTP service. |
| `providerKubeconfig.secretName` | `faros-provider-kubeconfig` | Bootstrap kubeconfig Secret. |
| `runtimeKubeconfig.secretName` | `linear-runtime-kubeconfig` | Runtime identity Secret. |
| `hub.url` | in-cluster Faros hub URL | Heartbeat and caller-scoped MCP API access. |
| `hub.insecure` | `false` | Development-only TLS relaxation. |
| `hub.tokenSecretRef` | empty | Optional heartbeat token override; otherwise runtime kubeconfig token. |
| `catalogEntry.enabled` | `true` | Self-register CatalogEntry from init. |
| `resources` | see values.yaml | Container CPU/memory requests and limits. |
| `serviceAccount`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, `affinity`, `podLabels`, `podAnnotations` | see values.yaml | Hosting settings. |

`/healthz` reports process liveness. `/readyz` requires successful export
reconciliation. Individual Connection readiness is separate and refreshed once
per minute; operations fetch credentials afresh and do not trust cached readiness.

For Linear deliveries, configure an external HTTPS ingress restricted to
`/webhooks/`; supply the exact cluster/connection callback path in
Linear. This chart does not create a public ingress or change Faros hub auth.
Subscription/signing configuration belongs to the tenant Connection, not Helm
values. API keys and signing secrets must never be committed or printed.

Connections, Operations, and Events are cluster-scoped inside each bound tenant
workspace. Only credential Secrets remain namespaced; API-key and webhook
signing references each default their namespace to `default`. Event admission
is limited to 1,000 retained events per tenant workspace. This experimental
scope change has no backward-compatible API routes or resource migration.

The Deployment uses `strategy.type: Recreate`. Upgrades briefly interrupt service
so the old and new provider processes do not overlap; `replicaCount: 1` alone
would not enforce that admission/recovery requirement with rolling updates.
The receiver returns HTTP 200 after Event persistence/deduplication, processes
requests with a four-second deadline, and returns 503 under admission contention.


### Team registrations

The export includes cluster-scoped Teams alongside Connections, Operations and
Events. Re-run provider initialization on upgrade to publish the Team schema and
updated Connection schema before starting the new controller. No new external
permission claims are required. All Connections require registered Teams before issue operations can run.
Team registration is an administrative capability; grant `create` on `teams`
only to callers allowed to extend workspace Linear access.

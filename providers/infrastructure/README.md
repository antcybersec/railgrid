A faros provider that brokers application templates from a central
[kro](https://github.com/kro-run/kro) (Kube Resource
Orchestrator) cluster into faros tenant workspaces. A tenant picks a
template in the faros portal — or asks an MCP-driven LLM — supplies
inputs, and this provider creates the kro instance CR on their behalf
using cloud credentials pulled from the tenant's own kcp workspace.

## Deploy (operator)

The recommended way to run the whole stack is the **CRD-driven operator**. You
give it a provider (kcp) kubeconfig and one `InfrastructureProvider` CR that
declares the kro + provider image versions; the operator does the rest —
continuously:

- bootstraps the provider kcp workspace (CRDs, APIExport, CachedResource,
  EndpointSlice, the `infrastructure` APIExportEndpointSlice, schemas, Templates);
- **lifecycles the kro Helm release** via the helm CLI (upstream kro,
  single-cluster; chart CRDs applied explicitly so version bumps carry them);
- owns the **provider serve Deployment** (image/replicas/port from the CR).

It is the same `infrastructure-provider` binary (`controller` subcommand); the
runtime image bundles the `helm` CLI so the operator pod can drive kro. The
chart binds the operator's ServiceAccount to an enumerated ClusterRole that
covers helm-installing kro (its CRDs, ClusterRole and binding, workload) and
the serve rollout, and ships a second enumerated role the operator binds the
serve ServiceAccount to for the in-cluster runtime. `operator.clusterAdmin`
(default off) additionally binds `cluster-admin` for setups whose kro chart or
Templates need kinds outside that set.

### Prerequisites

- The provider **workspace must already exist** — onboard/register the provider
  so `root:faros:providers:infrastructure` exists.
- A **provider (kcp) kubeconfig** scoped to that workspace (what the admin
  portal issues).

### Install — single cluster (recommended)

When the operator runs in the cluster where you want kro + the provider serve to
live, you only need the provider kubeconfig. Omit the runtime kubeconfig and the
operator uses its **own (in-cluster) cluster** as the runtime.

```sh
helm install infrastructure \
  oci://ghcr.io/faroshq/charts/faros-infrastructure-provider --version <X.Y.Z> \
  -n faros-infra-operator --create-namespace \
  --set operator.enabled=true \
  --set operator.providerWorkspace=root:faros:providers:infrastructure \
  --set-file operator.providerKubeconfig=./provider-infrastructure.kubeconfig \
  --set operator.kro.version=v0.0.1-mc.7 \
  --set hub.url=https://faros-hub.faros.svc.cluster.local:9443
```

### Install — separate runtime cluster

To run kro + serve in a different cluster, also pass its kubeconfig:

```sh
helm install infrastructure \
  oci://ghcr.io/faroshq/charts/faros-infrastructure-provider --version <X.Y.Z> \
  -n faros-infra-operator --create-namespace \
  --set operator.enabled=true \
  --set operator.providerWorkspace=root:faros:providers:infrastructure \
  --set-file operator.providerKubeconfig=./provider-infrastructure.kubeconfig \
  --set-file operator.runtimeKubeconfig=./runtime-cluster.kubeconfig \
  --set operator.kro.version=v0.0.1-mc.7
```

Values:

- `operator.providerKubeconfig` — the kcp provider kubeconfig. Or reference an
  existing Secret via `operator.providerKubeconfigSecret.name` and omit the
  inline value.
- `operator.runtimeKubeconfig` — **optional**; omit for the in-cluster runtime.
- `operator.kro.*` — chart/version/image of the kro release (defaults to
  upstream: `oci://registry.k8s.io/kro/charts/kro`, image from the chart's
  own defaults).
- `operator.provider.image.*` — the provider serve image (defaults to the chart
  image/appVersion).
- `operator.application.*` — the `application` template's exposure layer:
  `baseDomain` (the zone apps are served under; **required to enable app
  exposure**) and `gateway.name` / `gateway.namespace` (the Gateway API parent
  the generated HTTPRoutes attach to; default `cloudflare-tunnel` /
  `cfgate-system`). These render into the CR's `spec.application` and become the
  serve container's `FAROS_APP_BASE_DOMAIN` / `FAROS_GATEWAY_NAME` /
  `FAROS_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE`. See
  [docs/application-template-architecture.md](docs/application-template-architecture.md).

### Verify

```sh
kubectl -n faros-infra-operator get infrastructureprovider infrastructure -o wide
# PHASE → Ready; conditions Bootstrapped / KroReleased / ProviderDeployed = True
kubectl -n faros-infra-operator logs deploy/infrastructure-faros-infrastructure-provider-operator
kubectl -n kro-system get deploy kro
kubectl -n faros-infrastructure-provider get deploy,svc
```

### Upgrade

Image versions live in the CR/values — bump and re-reconcile:

```sh
helm upgrade infrastructure oci://ghcr.io/faroshq/charts/faros-infrastructure-provider --version <X.Y.Z> \
  -n faros-infra-operator --reuse-values \
  --set operator.kro.version=<new-kro> \
  --set operator.provider.image.tag=<new-provider>
```

### Image + chart publishing

[`.github/workflows/provider-release.yaml`](../../.github/workflows/provider-release.yaml)
is the sole publisher: an `infrastructure/vX.Y.Z` tag builds + pushes the
provider image (operator binary **and** the helm CLI baked in) and packages +
pushes the chart to `oci://ghcr.io/faroshq/charts/faros-infrastructure-provider`.
(`images.yaml` only build-validates the image on PRs; it does not publish.) Until
a release tag is cut, install from the local chart path
(`providers/infrastructure/deploy/chart`) with a provider image that contains the
helm CLI.

## What's here

| Surface | Where |
|---|---|
| HTTP server | `server/` — `/healthz`, portal SPA, `/mcp` |
| MCP transport | `mcpserver/` — `/mcp`, `/mcp/sse` (6 `kro_*` tools) |
| Central kro client | `kro/` — `ResourceGraphDefinition` discovery + instance lifecycle |
| Tenant kcp client | `tenant/` — per-tenant `cloud-credentials` Secret resolution |
| Portal micro-frontend | `portal/` — Vue 3 catalog + dynamic provision form + instance list |
| Operator | `operator/` + `apis/v1alpha1` — `InfrastructureProvider` CRD + reconciler |
| Helm chart | `deploy/chart/` — operator + provider Deployment + CatalogEntry |
| Per-cloud credential convention | [docs/credentials.md](docs/credentials.md) |
| Template-defined instance rendering | [docs/instance-views.md](docs/instance-views.md) |

The CatalogEntry ships with `apiExport.schemas: []` (pure broker, no
CRDs leak into tenant workspaces). The single `permissionClaim` is
`secrets get/list/watch` with `tenantScoped: true` so the provider
can read `cloud-credentials` after a tenant Enables it.

## Architecture

         discovers RGDs, creates/lists/deletes instances in
         per-tenant namespace faros-tenants-<hash>
```

kro runs in **`kcp-apiexport`** mode: the provider creates instance CRs in the
tenant's kcp workspace through its APIExport
`infrastructure.providers.faros.sh`; kro reads the `infrastructure`
APIExportEndpointSlice in the provider workspace to find the virtual-workspace
URL, watches instance CRs across every bound tenant workspace, and — with
`controller.deployToLocalRuntime=true` — materializes each instance's child
resources on the cluster kro runs in, while the instance object + status stay in
the tenant workspace.

**This provider is the sole owner of the runtime cluster.** The runtime
kubeconfig (`/var/run/secrets/kro/kubeconfig`), the kro RGDs, and the
workloads' internal Services are its private backend layer — no other
provider holds a credential into them. Consumers (e.g. App Studio) operate
infrastructure-owned workloads only through the instance CRs (control plane)
and their VW subresources (data plane: `sandboxrunners/{name}/{log,proxy,…}`),
as the tenant user. See the platform
[provider-isolation rule](../../docs/providers.md#provider-isolation-the-cross-provider-boundary)
and [`app-studio-runtime-decoupling.md`](../../docs/app-studio-runtime-decoupling.md).

## MCP integration

Add the endpoint to a Claude / Cursor / Cline config separately from
the central faros MCP aggregator:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "faros-kro": {
      "url": "https://<your-faros-hub>/services/providers/infrastructure/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <faros-bearer>" }
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server exposes six tools: `kro_list_templates`,
`kro_describe_template`, `kro_provision`, `kro_list_instances`,
`kro_get_instance`, `kro_delete_instance`. Identity (tenant + user) is
taken from the same bearer token the faros portal uses — the model
never needs to ask the user for a tenant path.

External providers cannot plug into the in-tree aggregator at
[providers/mcp/aggregate/](../mcp/aggregate/) (init()-only registration).
This provider therefore runs a standalone MCP server alongside the
central one.

## Universal coding sandbox

The platform-owned `universal-coding-sandbox` Template is disabled by default:
it is neither seeded nor admitted until `FAROS_CODING_SANDBOX_ENABLED=true` is
set by the operator. Enabling it also requires
`FAROS_DEV_IMAGE_UNIVERSAL` to be a complete immutable
`name@sha256:<64 lowercase hex digits>` reference, and
`FAROS_DEV_AGENT_IMAGE` must pin the injected/bootstrap `faros-dev-agent` image
to the same immutable form. The shipped image recipe is
`dev-agent/Dockerfile.universal`; it combines Node with Go and Python plus the
bounded `faros-dev-agent` workspace/exec data plane.

The sandbox is private (no hostname or HTTPRoute), uses a persistent workspace,
and enforces the 12-hour idle and hard lifetime bounds. Hosted installations
keep the feature disabled; BYO chart self-hosting values explicitly opt in and
must provide immutable universal and dev-agent image references.

Every synthesized development pod, the coding sandbox included, runs
PSS-restricted (non-root UID 1000, seccomp `RuntimeDefault`, all capabilities
dropped, no privilege escalation) but still shares the host kernel. Set
`FAROS_SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CLASS_NAME` (chart value `sandbox.runtimeClassName`, CR
field `spec.sandbox.runtimeClassName`) to the name of a hardened RuntimeClass
installed on the runtime cluster, `gvisor` or `kata`, before exposing App
Studio to untrusted users. Empty keeps the cluster default runtime.

## Tenant network isolation

All workspaces' instances run on one runtime cluster, one namespace per
workspace and kcp namespace (`<clusterID>-<namespace>`). Without a
NetworkPolicy that cluster is flat: a pod in one workspace can dial another
workspace's Services by DNS name and reach its private apps without passing
their access gate, its Postgres and Redis, or its browser instances. Cluster
IDs are not secret, so the namespace name protects nothing.

With chart value `tenantNetworkPolicy.enabled=true`
(`FAROS_TENANT_NETWORK_POLICY_ENABLED=true` on the serve process; in operator
mode the operator copies the chart's values onto the serve Deployment), the
Instance controller maintains an Ingress-only NetworkPolicy named
`faros-tenant-isolation` in every runtime namespace before it writes any
workload there. It admits:

- pods in the same namespace, so the access gate, cron jobs and
  `connections.*` keep working;
- pods in the same workspace's other runtime namespaces (labels
  `faros.sh/tenant` + `faros.sh/managed-by`, which the provider writes and
  backfills on namespaces that predate them);
- pods in the exposure Gateway's namespace (`FAROS_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE`);
- `tenantNetworkPolicy.allowedNamespaces` and `tenantNetworkPolicy.allowedCIDRs`.

Egress is not restricted, and template-shipped policies (the coding sandbox's
egress rules) are unaffected. The provider re-reads each policy at least every
10 minutes and restores hand edits to its spec; turning the switch off deletes
the policies it labelled as its own. Requirements and caveats:

- The CNI must enforce NetworkPolicy (Calico, Cilium, kindnet ≥ v0.24, …);
  otherwise the policy is inert.
- If the Gateway implementation runs its proxies outside the Gateway's
  namespace, add their namespace to `allowedNamespaces`.
- The development data plane (`faros sandbox sync/exec/logs/restart/env`, the
  browser template's proxy) reaches pods through the runtime kube-apiserver's
  `services/proxy`. When the apiserver does not run on the pod's node
  (managed control planes, dedicated control-plane nodes, konnectivity), its
  traffic arrives from an address the policy does not admit: add that range to
  `allowedCIDRs` (or `kube-system` to `allowedNamespaces` for
  konnectivity-agent), or those calls time out.
- The runtime credential needs `networkpolicies` get/create/update/delete and
  `namespaces` patch. The chart's serve ClusterRole includes them; an
  explicit runtime kubeconfig must grant them itself. With the policy enabled,
  a failure to write it fails the Instance's reconcile rather than running
  workloads without isolation.

## Env vars

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8081` | Listen port |
| `FAROS_HUB_URL` | (unset → heartbeat off) | Hub base URL for heartbeats |
| `FAROS_HUB_TOKEN` | (unset) | Bearer token for heartbeats |
| `FAROS_PROVIDER_NAME` | `infrastructure` | CatalogEntry name |
| `FAROS_HUB_INSECURE` | (unset) | `true` skips TLS verify on heartbeats |
| `FAROS_PROVIDER_KUBECONFIG` | `/var/run/secrets/faros/faros-provider-kubeconfig` | Mounted kcp kubeconfig |
| `FAROS_TENANT_CREDENTIALS_SECRET` | `cloud-credentials` | Secret name in tenant workspace |
| `FAROS_TENANT_CREDENTIALS_NAMESPACE` | `default` | Namespace in tenant workspace |
| `FAROS_CODING_SANDBOX_ENABLED` | `false` | Opts into seeding/admitting the platform-owned universal coding sandbox; enabled deployments require immutable universal and dev-agent images |
| `FAROS_DEV_IMAGE_UNIVERSAL` | `ghcr.io/faroshq/faros-universal-dev:latest` | Platform-selected Node/Go/Python image token; the coding sandbox gate accepts only a digest-pinned override |
| `FAROS_DEV_AGENT_IMAGE` | release build: `ghcr.io/faroshq/faros-dev-agent:<provider version>`; local build: `ghcr.io/faroshq/faros-dev-agent:latest` | Platform-selected injector and control-token bootstrap image; the coding sandbox gate accepts only a digest-pinned override. The default follows the binary's `-X main.buildVersion` stamp (the Dockerfile's `VERSION` build arg) so a release's sandboxes run that release's agent despite the injector's `IfNotPresent` pull policy |
| `FAROS_SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CLASS_NAME` | (unset → cluster default runtime) | RuntimeClass (`gvisor` or `kata`) stamped on every synthesized development pod, including the universal coding sandbox; required before serving untrusted users |
| `FAROS_TENANT_NETWORK_POLICY_ENABLED` | `false` | Maintain the tenant isolation NetworkPolicy in every runtime namespace (see "Tenant network isolation"); `false` removes the provider-owned ones |
| `FAROS_TENANT_NETWORK_POLICY_ALLOWED_NAMESPACES` | (unset) | Comma-separated extra namespaces admitted by that policy |
| `FAROS_TENANT_NETWORK_POLICY_ALLOWED_CIDRS` | (unset) | Comma-separated extra CIDRs (canonical form) admitted by that policy |
| `FAROS_DEV_ALLOW_TENANT_QUERY` | (unset) | `true` lets `?tenant=` replace `X-Faros-Tenant` (dev only) |
| `KRO_KUBECONFIG` | (unset → stub mode) | Central kro cluster kubeconfig |
| `KRO_NAMESPACE_PREFIX` | `faros-tenants-` | Per-tenant namespace prefix |

# Development

Everything below is for working on the provider locally or wiring it up by hand
(without the operator). For deploying, use the operator section above.

## Run locally (stub mode — no central kro needed)

```sh
# 1. Build the portal bundle.
npm --prefix portal install
npm --prefix portal run build

# 2. Run the provider. With KRO_KUBECONFIG unset, kro/stub.go serves
#    three baked-in templates so the UI is demoable without infra.
go run .
# → listening on :8081 (kro=*kro.stubClient tenant=false mcp=true)

# 3. Smoke test: liveness.
curl -s localhost:8081/healthz

# 4. MCP tools/list (note: SSE response — pipe through `head`). Templates
#    and instances are NOT served as REST — they are kro_* MCP tools and,
#    in a real cluster, CRDs read/written directly against kcp.
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' \
  localhost:8081/mcp | head
```

## Run against a real central kro cluster

Point `KRO_KUBECONFIG` at the central cluster's kubeconfig:

```sh
KRO_KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kro-kubeconfig \
FAROS_HUB_URL=https://console.127.0.0.1.sslip.io:9443 \
FAROS_HUB_TOKEN=test \
FAROS_HUB_INSECURE=true \
go run .
```

For the catalog to show real templates, the central kro cluster must
have RGDs labeled `faros.sh/expose=true`. See
[docs/credentials.md](docs/credentials.md) for the labeling /
annotation contract.

## Register with the hub

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig kcp-admin.kubeconfig \
  --context faros-admin \
  ws use root:faros:providers
kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
kubectl get catalogentry infrastructure -o yaml
# status.conditions[Ready].status flips True once heartbeats land.
```

Open the portal at `https://<hub>/ui/providers/infrastructure/`.

## Build the image

```sh
docker build -t faros-infrastructure-provider:dev .
```

## Manual kro install (without the operator)

The operator installs and lifecycles kro for you. To wire it by hand (e.g. for
the init-container bootstrap deploy below), install **upstream kro,
single-cluster**: tenants author the flattened `Instance` kind in kcp and the
provider's instance controller materializes the per-template kro CRs on the
runtime cluster, so kro never talks to kcp — no kcp kubeconfig, no
multicluster values, no ordering dance.

```sh
KRO_VERSION=0.9.3   # upstream release (must contain the SSA-finalizer deletion fix, ≥0.9.x)

# helm only installs crds/-dir CRDs on FIRST install; apply them explicitly
# so version bumps carry CRD schema changes too.
helm show crds oci://registry.k8s.io/kro/charts/kro --version "$KRO_VERSION" | kubectl apply -f -

helm install kro oci://registry.k8s.io/kro/charts/kro \
  --version "$KRO_VERSION" \
  -n kro-system --create-namespace
```

Verify:

```sh
kubectl -n kro-system rollout status deploy/kro
```

The provider's `infrastructure init` (or the operator's bootstrap) then seeds
Templates in kcp; the Template controller authors one RGD per template on this
cluster and the instance controller materializes tenant Instances into it.

## Deploy with Helm (init-container bootstrap, non-operator)

A single provider Deployment that self-bootstraps via an init container — the
pre-operator path. The provider needs a runtime kubeconfig to reach kcp, mounted
as the `faros-provider-kubeconfig` Secret. Onboard the provider in the faros
**admin portal**, download the issued kubeconfig, create the Secret, then deploy.

### 1. Create the Secret from the download

The Secret name must be `faros-provider-kubeconfig` and the key must be
`kubeconfig` (the chart defaults — `providerKubeconfig.secretName`):

```sh
kubectl create namespace infrastructure
kubectl -n infrastructure create secret generic faros-provider-kubeconfig \
  --from-file=kubeconfig=provider-infrastructure.kubeconfig
```

### 2. Deploy the chart

```sh
helm install infrastructure deploy/chart \
  -n infrastructure --create-namespace \
  --set hub.url=https://faros-hub.faros.svc.cluster.local:9443 \
  --set bootstrap.enabled=true
```

With `bootstrap.enabled=true`, an init container runs `infrastructure init`
— installing the CRDs / CachedResource / APIExport (and the `infrastructure`
APIExportEndpointSlice kro watches) into the provider workspace. The serve
container then reuses the same kubeconfig. The init/serve volume is **not**
`optional`, so the pod waits in `ContainerCreating` until the
`faros-provider-kubeconfig` Secret exists.

### Alternative: `supplied` — fully standalone, no hub

```sh
helm install infrastructure deploy/chart -n infrastructure --create-namespace \
  --set bootstrap.enabled=true \
  --set bootstrap.kubeconfigSource=supplied \
  --set bootstrap.workspacePath=root:faros:providers:infrastructure \
  --set-file bootstrap.kcpKubeconfig=./provider-workspace-admin.kubeconfig
```

The kubeconfig must be admin of `bootstrap.workspacePath`, and that workspace
must already exist. Prefer `bootstrap.kcpKubeconfigSecretRef` to an inline
kubeconfig in production.

`values.yaml` has the full configuration surface — image, replicas, hub URL, the
Secret references, the `bootstrap.*` block, the `operator.*` block, and the
toggle for whether the chart renders the `CatalogEntry`.

## `init` subcommand (bootstrap) env vars

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `INFRASTRUCTURE_ADMIN_KUBECONFIG` | (falls back to `KUBECONFIG`, then in-cluster) | kcp **admin** kubeconfig for the bootstrap |
| `INFRASTRUCTURE_WORKSPACE_PATH` | (unset) | Retarget the admin kubeconfig at `/clusters/<path>` (the provider workspace) |
| `INFRASTRUCTURE_KUBECONFIG` | `./infrastructure.kubeconfig` | Path the minted runtime kubeconfig is written to (file) |
| `INFRASTRUCTURE_RUNTIME_KUBECONFIG_SECRET` | (unset) | When set, also write the runtime kubeconfig into this host-cluster Secret |
| `INFRASTRUCTURE_RUNTIME_KUBECONFIG_NAMESPACE` | (`POD_NAMESPACE`, then `default`) | Namespace for the runtime Secret |
| `POD_NAMESPACE` | (unset) | Downward-API pod namespace; used when the namespace var above is unset |
| `HOST_KUBECONFIG` | (unset → in-cluster) | Out-of-cluster override for the host client that writes the runtime Secret |

## Running it yourself

This provider can run in your own cluster instead of on the platform. faros
creates a workspace for it in your organization, mints a credential scoped to
that workspace alone, and generates the exact `helm` commands — under
**Providers → Self-Hosting** in the portal.

Nothing to fill in: the generated command turns on **operator mode** — the same
mode the production install runs in — and substitutes the kubeconfig Secret
reference. The operator bootstraps the workspace, installs kro, and owns the
serve Deployment plus the runtime-cluster RBAC it needs, so a self-hosted copy
stands up unattended in a cluster that has nothing but the credential.

The `bootstrap.*` init-container flow documented above is superseded and is
*not* what self-hosting uses: it installs neither kro nor the serve pod's RBAC.

One platform-side prerequisite applies and is worth checking first: the shard's
`virtualWorkspaceURL` must be reachable from your cluster. If it is not, this
provider still installs, reports healthy, and reconciles Templates — but never
acts on an Instance, because Instances are watched through the APIExport virtual
workspace. See
[Platform prerequisite](../../docs/byo-providers.md#platform-prerequisite-a-publicly-dialable-virtual-workspace-url).

Once installed, the provider registers itself and your workspaces enable it
exactly like the platform copy. See
[docs/byo-providers.md](../../docs/byo-providers.md) for how the flow works, and
[deploy/chart/README.md](deploy/chart/README.md) for every chart value.

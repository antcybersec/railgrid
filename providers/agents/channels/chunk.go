// Long answers are split across messages rather than cut off.
//
// Every chat backend caps one message (Discord at 2000 characters, Telegram at
// 4096), and truncating there is fine for "the deploy finished" and ruinous for
// anything substantial: a research answer runs tens of thousands of characters,
// so the reader would get the first few percent and no indication the rest ever
// existed. Splitting is the only honest option — the agent did the work, and the
// person asked for it.
//
// The split prefers a paragraph break, then a line break, then a sentence, and
// only falls back to a hard cut when a single run of text has none of those. It
// never splits a UTF-8 rune.

// chunkMessage splits text into pieces of at most limit characters, breaking at
// the most natural boundary available. A limit of 0 or text that already fits
// returns a single piece.

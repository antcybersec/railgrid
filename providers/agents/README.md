# agents provider

Long-running personal AI agents: chat, scheduled and heartbeat runs, tool use,
approvals, budgets, and durable memory — reachable from Slack, Telegram,
Discord, SMTP, and the portal.

APIExport: `agents.railgrid.ai`, in `root:railgrid:providers:agents` (or your own
workspace when self-hosted).

## Messaging channels

Inbound chat (Slack, Telegram) arrives on a per-connection webhook URL. The URL
carries an HMAC token, but that only proves the caller knows the URL, so every
delivery is additionally verified with the platform's own secret before a
message can run an agent:

- **Slack** — paste the app **signing secret** (Slack app → Basic Information →
  App Credentials → Signing Secret) when creating the connection (or add it to
  an existing one via *Edit*). Requests are checked against
  `X-Slack-Signature` / `X-Slack-Request-Timestamp` (5-minute window). A
  Slack connection with inbound enabled and no signing secret shows
  `Error: webhook verification secret required; update the connection` and its events are
  rejected until one is added.
- **Telegram** — nothing to paste: the provider generates a webhook
  `secret_token` per connection and registers it with `setWebhook`; updates
  without the matching `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` are rejected.
  Connections created before this existed are migrated automatically at
  startup (the bot's registered webhook is re-registered with the token); if
  that fails the connection says so and **Enable inbound** fixes it.
- **Discord** — chat rides the bot's own gateway WebSocket (no public
  endpoint); **SMTP** is outbound only.

Duplicate deliveries (Slack retries, Telegram redelivery) are acknowledged
without running the agent again, and a full executor queue answers `503` with
`Retry-After` instead of dropping the message. See
[docs/agents-multi-channel.md](../../docs/agents-multi-channel.md#inbound-verification-de-duplication-and-quarantine).

## Dependencies

The only hard dependencies are the **hub** and **Postgres**. That is deliberate:
agents is meant to run on its own.

The hub is also how the provider reaches a tenant's workspace. Every portal,
CLI, and MCP request carries the caller's bearer token and the workspace's
cluster ID (`X-Railgrid-Cluster`); the provider turns those into a plain kube
REST client on the hub's kcp proxy at `<RAILGRID_HUB_URL>/clusters/<cluster-id>`
and acts as the caller. The proxy authorizes by workspace membership, so the
provider can read and write Agents, Connections, Toolsets, and Secrets in any
workspace the caller belongs to, with kcp's own admission and RBAC errors
surfacing unchanged. `RAILGRID_HUB_INSECURE` relaxes TLS for in-cluster hub
certificates.

Compute- and storage-backed features — the claude-code runner and the file
workspace — light up only when the `infrastructure` provider is present.
Infrastructure is therefore an *optional* dependency, and is intentionally not
listed under `spec.dependencies`: declaring it would gate enablement on a
provider most installs do not need.

Configure storage with `store.databaseURLSecretRef`. See
[deploy/chart/README.md](deploy/chart/README.md) for every value.

## Running it

- **On the platform**, an admin onboards the provider and mints its credential.
- **Yourself**, railgrid creates a workspace in your organization, mints a
  credential scoped to it, and generates the install commands under
  **Providers → Self-Hosting** in the portal. See
  [docs/byo-providers.md](../../docs/byo-providers.md).

Self-hosting is the usual choice here if you want the agents' data — conversation
history, memory, credentials for the channels they speak on — to stay in your own
Postgres and your own cluster.

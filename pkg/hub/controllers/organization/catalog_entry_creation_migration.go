// catalogEntryCreationBackfill runs BackfillCatalogEntryCreation once the
// manager's caches are synced, retrying until it succeeds or the manager
// stops. It is registered from SetupWithManager so the hub needs no extra
// wiring, and it never fails the manager: a transient apiserver error must
// not take the whole controller down.
//
// The backfill stops after one successful pass, so that pass has to see every
// Organization that exists. Two things make that true, and both are needed:
//
//   - The list goes through mgr.GetAPIReader(), which reads the apiserver
//     directly. mgr.GetClient() would read the informer cache, and a cache
//     that has not been populated yet answers with an empty list — a result
//     this runnable cannot tell apart from "no Organizations exist", after
//     which it would exit having silently migrated nothing. Every remaining
//     Organization would keep an empty spec.catalogEntryCreation, which now
//     reads as "admin", quietly taking provider registration away from
//     members.
//   - It blocks on cache sync first anyway. mgr.Add puts a plain
//     RunnableFunc in the leader-election group, which controller-runtime
//     starts only after the cache group has synced — but that is a property
//     of how this runnable happens to be classified, not something the code
//     states, and it would change the moment someone gave it a
//     NeedLeaderElection method. The explicit wait keeps the guarantee local.

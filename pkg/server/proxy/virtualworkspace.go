// APIExport virtual-workspace relaying.
//
// A provider watches every workspace that consumes its APIExport through kcp's
// virtual workspace, whose address kcp copies from Shard.spec.virtualWorkspaceURL
// into APIExportEndpointSlice.status.endpoints[].url. Point that at a service
// DNS name and only consumers inside the shard's own cluster can dial it — which
// is fine for platform providers and fatal for self-hosted ones, whose failure
// is quiet: Templates live in the provider's own workspace and keep reconciling
// over the provider kubeconfig, so the provider looks healthy while never acting
// on a single tenant Instance.
//
// Relaying here lets a single-shard or embedded platform publish its ONE public
// hub address as the virtual-workspace URL, so the operator exposes one
// entrypoint rather than one per shard.
//
// This does not generalize to multiple shards. A multi-shard
// APIExportEndpointSlice carries one endpoint per shard, each derived from that
// shard's own virtualWorkspaceURL, and nothing in the request distinguishes
// them — the cluster segment identifies the APIExport's workspace, not the shard
// serving it. A SaaS deployment must give each shard its own reachable URL.
// See docs/byo-providers.md.

// virtualWorkspaceRequest is a parsed APIExport virtual-workspace URL:
//
//	/services/apiexport/{cluster}/{export}/clusters/{wildcard}/apis/...
//	                    ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^
//
// Cluster is the logical cluster holding the APIExport — NOT the workspace
// being read through it, which appears later in the path and is kcp's to
// authorize.

// clusterSegmentRE matches a kcp logical cluster id or a colon-separated
// workspace path. Same shape serveServiceAccount validates the clusterName
// claim against, so a token can never match a segment it could not also name.

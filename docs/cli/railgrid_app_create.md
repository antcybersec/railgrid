## railgrid app create

Create a project (repository, scaffold commit and dev instance)

### Synopsis

Create an App Studio project. One call creates the code Repository, the
GitHub repo, the scaffold commit and the <name>-dev instance.

The name is used as given for the project and its code Repository; it is never
suffixed. If a Repository with that name already exists (often one left behind
by a deleted project, which keeps its repository), the hub answers 409 Conflict:
choose another name. Without a validated Git connection the project starts with
no repository, and one connected later gets a suffixed name, so read the
repository ref from 'railgrid app status'. With --wait the command returns
once the repository is ready and the scaffold commit has succeeded — the point
from which cloning and 'railgrid commit' work. Without --template, --prompt lets
App Studio infer the template. --existing-repository adopts a code Repository
you created first (one that names an existing GitHub repo): the project
hydrates from its default branch instead of getting a scaffold, and nothing in
that repository's history is promotable until the first 'railgrid commit'.

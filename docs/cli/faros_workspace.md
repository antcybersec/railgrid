## faros workspace

Workspaces of an organization, and who is in them

### Synopsis

A workspace is the Kubernetes-style API you work in: edges, providers and
their resources live there, and access is per workspace.

  faros workspace list                      # workspaces in the current org
  faros workspace list --org acme
  faros workspace members                   # members of the current workspace
  faros workspace members --workspace platform
  faros workspace create "Platform"
  faros use --workspace platform            # make it the kubectl target

```
faros workspace [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help               help for workspace
      --org string         Organization display name or UUID (default: the org that owns the kubeconfig's workspace)
      --workspace string   Workspace display name or UUID (default: the workspace the kubeconfig points at)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

      --kubeconfig string          Path to the kubeconfig file (default: $KUBECONFIG, then ~/.kube/config)

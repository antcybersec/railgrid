## railgrid commit

Record local git commits through railgrid (code__commit_files)

### Synopsis

Send the commits on HEAD that are not yet on <remote>/<branch> to the
code provider's commit_files tool, so the commit is railgrid-recorded and App
Studio can build and promote it. Never 'git push' to a railgrid-managed repo.

Run inside a clone of the repository:

  git add -A && git commit -m "Add cart"     # commit locally, do not push
  railgrid commit shop                          # <repositoryRef> is the code Repository name

Every file that differs between <remote>/<branch> and HEAD is sent (deletions
as deletePaths), with the local commit subjects as the message (capped at 512
characters). Binary files are sent base64-encoded (at most 25 MiB each, 48 MiB
per commit) when the hub's code provider supports them; otherwise the command
refuses the change. When railgrid reports Succeeded the command
fetches, checks that <remote>/<branch> now has exactly your HEAD tree, and
resets the local branch onto it, so your clone carries the railgrid-recorded SHA.
The commit SHA is printed on stdout.

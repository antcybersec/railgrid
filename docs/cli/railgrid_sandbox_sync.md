## railgrid sandbox sync

Push a directory into the component workspace (authoritative)

### Synopsis

Push every non-ignored file under dir (default ".") into the component
workspace. Inside a git repository the file list is 'git ls-files -co
--exclude-standard'; elsewhere every file minus node_modules/, dist/ and .git/.

The sync is authoritative: it carries a source revision and a digest over the
whole file set, replaces the managed file set, and is what exec verifies
against. Binary files (not UTF-8, or containing NUL) are sent base64-encoded
when the component's dev agent advertises base64 sync (at most 25 MiB per
binary file, 48 MiB per sync); against an older agent they are skipped with a
warning.

For an App Studio project's <project>-dev instance, 'railgrid app sync <project>'
pushes App Studio's own file set instead; a sandbox sync replaces that set.

# Theme and degraded-path mechanics

Exactly one of `html.dark` or `html.light` is always set for the portal and
light-DOM provider surfaces. `portal/index.html` ships `class="light"`, the
pre-paint script in `portal/public/theme-bootstrap.js` defaults to light when
preference is unset or unreadable, and the runtime store in
`portal/src/stores/theme.ts` cycles `light → dark → system`. No Tailwind `dark:`
variant is used; theming is pure CSS-variable flipping. If a variant seems
necessary, inspect the warning in `main.css` first.

Dex auth is a fixed-dark standalone exception, not a participant in the
portal theme toggle. `hack/dex/web/static/main.css` sets `color-scheme: dark`
and the dark `--faros-*` palette. Dex's dark and light theme hook files remain
available for its URL contract, but the light hook contains no alternate
palette; do not document or expose a Dex light mode.

Portal styles never use `@media (prefers-color-scheme)` because it fights the
class toggle. Standalone dev-harness pages under `providers/*/portal/public/`
are the only exception because they have no toggle. New tokens are added to
both the dark `@theme` block and the `html.light` block and then documented in
[color tokens](colors.md); a token present in only one theme is a bug.

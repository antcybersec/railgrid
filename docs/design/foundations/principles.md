# Principles

Violet Circuit is the shared visual constitution for the host portal, provider
micro-frontends, PortalKit, and the Dex login page. Its one-sentence character
is near-black violet-tinted ground, hairline borders, sharp corners, dense
mono-heavy type, and one violet accent that glows only on things that are alive.

1. **Both themes are first-class.** The portal and provider themes use a dark
   token base (`@theme` in `portal/src/assets/main.css`) with an `html.light`
   override; every supported component must hold up on both grounds. Light is
   the default and hard fallback in every degraded portal/provider path
   (JavaScript off, `matchMedia` missing, or storage errors). Dex auth is a
   separate fixed-dark standalone surface, documented in
   [theme mechanics](theming.md).
2. **Sharp, not soft.** The [radius law](geometry.md) separates this system
   from template-grade SaaS. Never reintroduce a softer radius for one card.
3. **Glow means alive.** Light is a signal, not decoration. Only the active nav
   item, solid-accent primary buttons, focused inputs, and live dot may emit it.
   Everything else is flat; a decorative glow is off-system.
4. **Borders, not shadows.** Depth comes from 1px hairlines and surface steps,
   not drop shadows. Allowed shadows are the barely-there card lift (`0 1px
   2px`), modal/popover elevation, and sanctioned glows.
5. **Tokens or nothing.** Every color goes through `var(--color-*)`. A raw hex
   in a component is a bug, except for the [sanctioned exceptions](../quality/exceptions.md).
6. **Mono is the voice of the machine.** Identifiers, statuses, paths,
   timestamps, badges, table headers, and anything the system says about itself
   use IBM Plex Mono, usually small, often uppercase and letter-spaced.

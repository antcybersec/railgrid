# ConfirmDialog and modal support

## Purpose

Use the promise-based `confirmDialog()` plus one root `<ConfirmDialog />` in Vue,
or `confirmModal()`/`alertModal()` from vanilla PortalKit. Native
`window.confirm` and `window.alert` are forbidden. The caller owns the
destructive action and awaits a boolean result; row delete actions pass
`danger: true`.

## Use when

Use the shared promise-based helpers whenever an in-page confirmation or alert
is needed. Vue consumers mount one root `<ConfirmDialog />`; vanilla consumers
use `confirmModal()` or `alertModal()` from PortalKit.

## Avoid when

Never use native `window.confirm` or `window.alert`. Do not move the destructive
mutation into the dialog: the caller owns the action and awaits the boolean
result.

## Anatomy and variants

Vue uses `confirmDialog()` with one root `<ConfirmDialog />`; vanilla PortalKit
uses `confirmModal()`/`alertModal()`. Solid danger is allowed inside a
confirmation dialog, but it never glows. Both helpers use the shared bounded,
wrapping confirmation geometry.

## Behavior

The caller awaits a boolean result and owns the destructive action. Row delete
actions pass `danger: true`. A danger confirmation initially focuses Cancel;
the dialog's key handler is scoped to the dialog and does not convert arbitrary
page Enter keydown into confirmation. Native Enter activates the focused button.
Escape and backdrop cancel, and focus returns to the previously focused
connected element.

## Content

Use confirmation or alert copy appropriate to the caller-owned action. The
dialog's danger treatment is reserved for the destructive confirmation action;
the solid danger treatment never glows.

## Layout and responsive behavior

Confirmation dialogs and modals are 6px, `surface-raised`, and hairlined with
heavy elevation. The confirmation variant is bounded to the viewport, scrolls
long message bodies, wraps long titles and action labels, and wraps its footer
actions. Its scrim derives from `surface` (`bg-surface/60` or
`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-surface) 60%, transparent)`), never from text or
`bg-black/*`, so dark and light themes remain dark-on-dark and light-on-light.

## Accessibility

Use the shared in-page dialog so the interaction has the common dialog
semantics and focus behavior; native browser dialogs are not part of this
contract. The caller's action remains available through the promise result.

## Code and evidence

Canonical implementations are [`ConfirmDialog.vue`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit-vue/ConfirmDialog.vue),
[`confirm.ts`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit-vue/confirm.ts), and
[`modal.ts`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit/modal.ts). Distribution is checked
by `make verify-portalkit`.

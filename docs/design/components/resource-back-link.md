# ResourceBackLink

## Purpose

Use `ResourceBackLink` before and outside a `ResourcePage` shell on Vue detail
routes. It always renders a real `href`. The optional `iconOnly` variant
defaults to `false`; when enabled it uses the compact `.k-ai-conversation-back`
recipe and renders only the arrow, so the caller must provide an accessible
name such as `aria-label` and `title`. Only an unmodified primary activation
may be intercepted for caller-owned SPA `back` routing; modified and non-primary
clicks retain native browser behavior. A disabled link prevents navigation and
`back` emission, exposes `aria-disabled="true"`, and remains out of keyboard
tab order with `tabindex="-1"`. Its arrow flips in RTL.

## Use when

Use it before and outside a `ResourcePage` shell on Vue detail routes. Set
`iconOnly` only when placing the link in a conversation header; its real `href`
and caller-owned `back` event remain in force. Use the `.k-back-action` recipe
directly for create flows and other non-detail controls.

## Avoid when

Do not replace the detail route's single return affordance with provider-level
collection tabs. Do not use a JavaScript-only action in place of the real
`href`; modified and non-primary clicks must retain native browser behavior.

## Anatomy and variants

The component always renders a real `href` and uses the `.k-back-action` recipe:
intrinsic-width, start-aligned, borderless, 12px/500 accent text with a 6px icon
gap, accent-hover underline, and no control surface. With `iconOnly` (default
`false`), it adds `.k-ai-conversation-back`, hides the visible `Back` slot text,
and uses a centered 32px control with a 16px arrow. Its arrow flips in RTL.

## Behavior

Only an unmodified primary activation may be intercepted for caller-owned SPA
`back` routing. Modified and non-primary clicks retain native browser behavior.
A disabled link prevents navigation and `back` emission, exposes
`aria-disabled="true"`, and remains out of keyboard tab order with
`tabindex="-1"`. Icon-only callers must retain an accessible name on the link.

## Content

The component is the single return affordance on a detail route. Route-specific
destination and visible wording remain caller-owned; use the recipe directly
for create flows and other non-detail controls.

## Layout and responsive behavior

The `.k-back-action` recipe is intrinsic-width, start-aligned, borderless, and
has a 6px icon gap. The icon-only conversation recipe is 32px on fine pointers;
coarse and hybrid any-pointer targets are at least 44×44px.

## Accessibility

The real `href` preserves native link behavior. A disabled link exposes
`aria-disabled="true"` and `tabindex="-1"`; modified and non-primary clicks are
not intercepted. The target-size rule applies to coarse and hybrid pointers.

## Code and evidence

The canonical implementation is [`ResourceBackLink.vue`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit-vue/ResourceBackLink.vue),
with shared styling in [`railgrid-ui.css`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit/railgrid-ui.css).
Distribution is checked by `make verify-portalkit`.

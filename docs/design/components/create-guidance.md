# CreateGuidance

## Purpose

When a route-owned form benefits from domain help, place `CreateGuidance.vue`
beside a `k-create-fields` region inside `k-create-surface--guided`. The rail
contains only timely prerequisites, a live and non-secret summary of what Railgrid
will create, and controller-owned next steps. Provider copy and value derivation
remain local.

## Use when

Use this guidance rail when a route-owned form benefits from domain help. Place
it beside the `k-create-fields` region inside `k-create-surface--guided`.

## Avoid when

Do not turn the rail into a general documentation surface or move provider copy
and value derivation into the shared component. Its content is limited to timely
prerequisites, a live non-secret summary, and controller-owned next steps.

## Anatomy and variants

The guided surface has a `k-create-fields` region beside the
`CreateGuidance.vue` rail. Provider copy and value derivation remain local;
the shared component supplies the guidance-rail structure.

## Behavior

The rail presents a live, non-secret summary of what Railgrid will create and
controller-owned next steps. It contains timely prerequisites rather than stale
or unrelated help.

## Content

Include only timely prerequisites, a live and non-secret summary of what Railgrid
will create, and controller-owned next steps. Provider copy and value derivation
remain local.

## Layout and responsive behavior

The shared container query places fields before guidance on narrow surfaces and
keeps both regions fluid at desktop and 4K widths. See the [resource creation
pattern](../patterns/resource-creation.md) for choosing this surface and the
canonical footer.

## Accessibility

No standalone keyboard model applies: `CreateGuidance` is a guidance rail, not
an interactive composite control. Keep its content within the owning form's
accessible structure and preserve the form's control labels.

## Code and evidence

The canonical component is [`CreateGuidance.vue`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit-vue/CreateGuidance.vue),
with shared styling in [`railgrid-ui.css`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit/railgrid-ui.css).
Distribution is checked by `make verify-portalkit`.

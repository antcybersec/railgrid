# PortalKit provider route tabs

## Purpose

This labeled icon-plus-label navigation is the provider-level route/section bar.
The vanilla helper and Vue component share the canonical `k-tabs` recipe;
callers own routing and selected state.

## Use when

Use this bar for provider-level routes or sections. It is used by Agents, App
Studio, Code, Databricks, Edges, and Kuery. Infrastructure and Quickstart have
no equivalent provider-level bar.

## Avoid when

Detail/workbench tabsets are not automatically route tabs. Do not use provider
route tabs to imply that a detail/workbench tabset follows this contract.

## Anatomy and variants

Markup is a labeled `nav` with optional count tags. Each tab is
`type="button"`; the active tab exposes `aria-current="page"`. `Tabs.vue`
emits `select` and exposes each id as `data-k-tab-id`; the vanilla `tabs.ts`
helper adds the same class vocabulary.

## Behavior

Routing and selected state remain caller-owned. Idle tabs use muted text on
transparent; hover uses `surface-hover`; active tabs use accent text on
`accent-subtle`. Tabs have no glow or shadow.

## Content

Use labeled icon-plus-label tabs. Counts are optional and use square 3px mono
tags; the label remains the route/section name rather than an icon-only cue.

## Layout and responsive behavior

Tabs use 4px controls, `padding: 7px 13px`, 4px gap, and a 1px bottom hairline.
Narrow hosts keep the row horizontal and allow overflow.

## Accessibility

Use labeled `nav` markup, `type="button"` tabs, and
`aria-current="page"` on the active tab. The 2px focus-visible outline is
required; the [accessible interaction policy](../accessibility/interaction.md)
supplies the broader keyboard, focus, and naming contract.

## Code and evidence

Canonical implementations are `provider-sdk/portalkit/tabs.ts`,
`provider-sdk/portalkit-vue/Tabs.vue`, and
`provider-sdk/portalkit/railgrid-ui.css`. Verify with `make verify-portalkit`.

## Related guidance

Compose route tabs with the [navigation and feedback pattern](../patterns/navigation-and-feedback.md),
use the [color foundation](../foundations/colors.md) for active/idle tones, and
follow the [accessible interaction policy](../accessibility/interaction.md) and
[review checklist](../quality/review-checklist.md).

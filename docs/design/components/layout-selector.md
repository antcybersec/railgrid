# LayoutSelector

## Purpose

Use `LayoutSelector` when one resource collection has grid and list
presentations. It is controlled through `modelValue` and
`update:modelValue`, with exactly two stable values: `grid` and `list`.
`layoutPreference.ts` validates stored values, defaults to `grid`, and treats
unavailable or failing browser storage as a non-fatal preference miss.

## Use when

Use it when one resource collection offers grid and list presentations. Keep the
control controlled through `modelValue` and `update:modelValue`.

## Avoid when

Do not add a third layout mode: the stable values are exactly `grid` and `list`.
Storage failure or an unavailable browser storage API is a non-fatal preference
miss, not a reason to block the collection.

## Anatomy and variants

The trigger is a compact current-layout icon plus chevron with
`aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and an accessible name that
includes the current mode. Focus is a crisp accent outline and never a glow.
The menu has a visible mono-uppercase Layout label and `role="menu"`; Grid and
List are `role="menuitemradio"` with `aria-checked`. Selection uses the
accent-subtle menu state and no glow.

## Behavior

Click, Enter, and Space select. Closed ArrowDown/ArrowUp opens on the first or
last item; open arrows wrap; Home/End jump; Escape closes and restores trigger
focus. When Tab is pressed, the teleported menu closes and synchronously returns
focus to its own trigger before native adjacent focus movement; focus is not
trapped after that handoff. Deactivating a cached view closes its teleported
menu. Pointer or focus movement outside closes the menu.
`layoutPreference.ts` validates stored values, defaults to `grid`, and treats
unavailable or failing browser storage as a non-fatal preference miss.

## Content

The menu has a visible mono-uppercase `Layout` label. Grid and List are the only
default choices, and the trigger's accessible name includes the current mode.
For a board presentation, callers may set `gridLabel` (for example, `Board`)
and `gridIcon`. These change presentation only; emitted values stay `grid` and
`list`, and callers map them to their own saved preferences. Existing callers
retain the Grid label and icon.

## Layout and responsive behavior

The trigger is compact and shows the current-layout icon plus chevron. The menu
is teleported to `body` and uses `useAnchoredPopover` for viewport-bounded,
resize/scroll-updated placement with above-trigger fallback when needed.
Selection uses `accent-subtle` and never glows.

## Accessibility

The trigger exposes `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls`. The
menu uses `role="menu"`; Grid and List use `role="menuitemradio"` with
`aria-checked`. Focus is a crisp accent outline and never a glow. The keyboard,
focus-return, and native Tab-exit behavior above is part of the contract.

## Code and evidence

Canonical implementations are [`LayoutSelector.vue`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit-vue/LayoutSelector.vue),
[`useAnchoredPopover.ts`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit-vue/useAnchoredPopover.ts),
and [`layoutPreference.ts`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit-vue/layoutPreference.ts).
Distribution is checked by `make verify-portalkit`.

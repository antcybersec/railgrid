# Violet Circuit system map

The system is one contract with several layers. [Principles](foundations/principles.md)
state what must remain true. [Tokens and geometry](foundations/colors.md) and
[typography](foundations/typography.md) provide the vocabulary. [Recipes](foundations/recipes.md)
and [components](components/) provide reusable implementation contracts.
[Patterns](patterns/) explain how components compose into complete journeys.
[Quality](quality/) is the review and conformance boundary.

The host portal and every provider micro-frontend share one visual language.
Provider implementation status is intentionally explicit in each entry's
metadata so a planned build-to-this specification cannot be mistaken for
runtime evidence.
